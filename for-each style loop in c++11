c++ 11 version provides its own for each type loop

the syntax is :

for( type i : coll)
type is the type of collection on which the loop will run and coll is the name of the collection which is going to be processed

ex:-

.........................

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	vector <string> s{"win","patience","hard work","dediction","passion"};

	for( auto i:s)
	cout<<i<<" ";
	
			
}

...................................................

important point to mention here is that for-each loop works on a local copy
so if you make any modificaations to it inside the loop it will not reflect in original 
for that we use & side and pass the value by reference

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	vector <string> s{"win","patience","hard work","dediction","passion"};

	for( auto& i:s)
	{
		i=i+"love";
		cout<<i<<" ";
	}
	
			
}
