c++ 11 version provides its own for each type loop

the syntax is :

for( type i : coll)
type is the type of collection on which the loop will run and coll is the name of the collection which is going to be processed

ex:-

.........................

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	vector <string> s{"win","patience","hard work","dediction","passion"};

	for( auto i:s)
	cout<<i<<" ";
	
			
}
